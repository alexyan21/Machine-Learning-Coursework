# Machine-Learning
Here are coursework of machine learning class based on Python and edited by Jupyter Notebooks. Topics covered in this course include:

### Data Mining Overview  
* The KDD Process
### Data Preprocessing and Understanding
* Using Python, Numpy, Pandas
* Using Scikit-learn modules
* Some emphasis on visualizing and understanding characteristics of the data
### Supervised Knowledge Discovery
* Classification
* Regression Analysis
* Techniques such as KNN, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree and Bayesian classification
* Lots of emphasis on model evaluation <br>
 -Evaluation metrics <br>
 -Train-Test methodologies such as cross-validation <br>
 -Systematic parameter selection (e.g., grid search) <br>
### Unsupervised Knowledge Discovery
* Cluster analysis
* Using PCA and SVD for dimensionality reduction, data characterization, and noise reduction.
* Association rule discovery
* Emphasis on using unsupervised approaches as components of larger knowledge discovery efforts <br>
 -E.g., using PCA before clustering; using clustering as the basis for classification
### Real application domains
* Text Mining and document analysis/filtering
* Recommender systems
* Predictive modeling for marketing/business applications
* Image analysis
### Approaches for mining sequential/temporal data
* Markov models; time series analysis, sequential pattern mining
### More Ensemble and Hybrid Classifiers/Predictors
* Combining multiple classifiers
* Random Forest classifiers
* Other Meta-learners such as Ada Boost
### Support Vector Machines and Kernel-Based Classifiers
### Topic modeling with Latent factor models
* LDA  Latent Dirichlet Allocation
